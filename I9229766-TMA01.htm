<p>Lossless and lossy compression are methods of reducing data size. Lossless compression allows the complete restoration of the original data, while lossy compression results in some data loss. Lossless compression is preferred for text documents and spreadsheets, where every piece of information is crucial.</p>
<p>In contrast, lossy compression is commonly used for images, audio, and video, where minor losses of data are generally acceptable. Lossy compression results in higher compression ratios and smaller file sizes, while lossless compression preserves all data but often results in a larger file size. In image compression, lossy compression is preferred when high-quality is not a priority, and a smaller file size is essential. Conversely, lossless compression is recommended for high-quality images in professional photography, graphic design, or medical imaging, where every detail is critical and must be preserved.</p>
